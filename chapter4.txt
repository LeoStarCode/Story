Chapter 4 — Echoes of the Light

Days passed, but the town’s radio waves stayed eerily quiet—except for Channel 8. At first, Maya thought she’d imagined it, but the faint breathing-like static returned, pulsing in perfect rhythm.
She found herself drawn to the old satellite dish again, despite the warnings in her own mind. The triangular lights returned, hovering over the town’s outskirts, brighter and closer than before.
This time, the voice wasn’t alone: dozens of others spoke in harmony, repeating: “We are here. We are waiting.”
Maya’s hands shook as her recorder captured everything. Then, suddenly, the lights shot upward, vanishing into the sky, leaving behind a single, glowing orb above the dish.
A new message played in her mind, not over the radio: “When the world sleeps, we return. Are you ready to guide them?”
Maya realized she wasn’t just a witness anymore—she had become part of something far larger, and humanity might never know the difference.
