Chapter 4 — Déjà Vu in Brass

Elior stared at the tall man in the doorway, his heart pounding for reasons he couldn’t explain.
“Can you fix this?” the man asked, handing over the silver watch. The crack in the glass was identical, the hands still frozen at 11:59.
Elior hesitated, a strange chill running down his spine. He swore he’d seen this before—lived this before—but the memory slipped away every time he tried to grab it.
When he opened the watch’s back, the tiny hourglass was already almost empty… but this time, the sand wasn’t moving up or down. It hovered in place, trembling.
The man’s eyes narrowed. “Something’s wrong. Someone remembers.”
Elior looked up. “What happens if I don’t fix it?”
The man smiled, not kindly. “Then time breaks—for all of us.”
